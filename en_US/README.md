## Introduction

Every week, we meet to discuss and show new and interesting ways to make use of the terminal, also know as the *Command Line Interface*, in this activity which we've dearly named **Shellpunks**.

We've founded this activity with the belief that in cooperation and autonomy, we find the motors of our development. Both as individuals, as a community. The idea of disposing of information as a privilege, for any reason, will find of us nothing but the most absolute contempt. Whenever possible, we make available everything that we demonstrate. That way, everyone should be capable to make use of our contributions and contribute to reach grander objectives as a whole.

Through the results presented at Shellpunks, we build and maintain here a list of resources of interest to its participants. **To know more about this event, how to participate and contribute to it, consult our [Wiki](https://gitlab.com/paradigma_/shellpunks/wiki) page on it or come chat with us on [Telegram](t.me/paradigma_icu)**
